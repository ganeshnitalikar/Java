/*
public String replaceâ€‹(char oldChar, char newChar)
Returns a string resulting from replacing all occurrences of oldChar in this string with newChar.
If the character oldChar does not occur in the character sequence represented by this String object, then a reference to this String object is returned. Otherwise, a String object is returned that represents a character sequence identical to the character sequence represented by this String object, except that every occurrence of oldChar is replaced by an occurrence of newChar.

Examples:

 "mesquite in your cellar".replace('e', 'o')
         returns "mosquito in your collar"
 "the war of baronets".replace('r', 'y')
         returns "the way of bayonets"
 "sparring with a purple porpoise".replace('p', 't')
         returns "starring with a turtle tortoise"
 "JonL".replace('q', 'x') returns "JonL" (no change)
 
Parameters:
oldChar - the old character.
newChar - the new character.
Returns:
a string derived from this string by replacing every occurrence of oldChar with newChar.
